# This script will take a data input of product ingredients and output a sustainability score

# The score is based on the criteria described in the notion document "Sustainability Score"

# We will start by importing relevant packages and sample dataset
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import openai

# The data we will be looking for contains product and manufacturer information and country of origin.
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Using the data, we will create a function that will take in a product name and output a sustainability score
def sustainability_score(carbon, water, recyclability, energy, sourcing):
    # First we need to use the ingredients to establish a consensus about the following categories:
        # Carbon footprint
        # Water footprint
        # Recyclability
        # Energy efficiency
        # Materials sourcing
    # For now we will just sum the values of each category
    return carbon + water + recyclability + energy + sourcing

def carbon_calc(data):
    # This function will give a carbon footprint score based on the data
    return 0

def water_calc(data):
    # This function will give a carbon footprint score based on the data
    return 0

def recyclability_calc(data):
    # This function will give a carbon footprint score based on the data
    return 0

def energy_calc(data):
    # This function will give a carbon footprint score based on the data
    return 0

def sourcing_calc(data):
    # This function will give a carbon footprint score based on the data
    return 0

# Now we just need a main function that will run the sustainability score function and save the score to a json file.
def main(data):
    carbon = carbon_calc(data)
    water = water_calc(data)
    recyclability = recyclability_calc(data)
    energy = energy_calc(data)
    sourcing = sourcing_calc(data)
    # Then we need to run the sustainability score function
    score = sustainability_score(carbon, water, recyclability, energy, sourcing)
    return score
